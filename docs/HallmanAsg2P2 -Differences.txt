After running both modified versions of the Hanoi programs multiple times, the iterative version generally performed better with a larger number of disks due to the reduced overhead associated with function calls.
The recursive version, while simpler and more refined, is impractical for larger inputs because of the exponential increase in recursive calls and the associated overhead.
